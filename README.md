The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 
G and 
B, the number of girl and boy students at IIT (BHU) respectively.
## Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer on a new line, the minimum number of boy students from IIT (BHU) who would not be able to participate.

## Constraints
  1<=T<=100
  1<=G<B<=100
## Sample 1:
